Project through Free Code Camp.  Goal was to recreate the following web application without looking at source code: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/wGqEga/

The User Story is:  (1) I can search Wikipedia entries in a search box and see the resulting Wikipedia entries and (2) I can click a button to see a random Wikipedia entry.

The project involved accessing the Wikipedia API through AJAX and developing user interface using HTML, CSS and Javascript.
